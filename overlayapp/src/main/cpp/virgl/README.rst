Support

Many Virglrenderer devs hang on IRC; if you're not sure which channel is
appropriate, you should ask your question on `OFTC's #virgil3d
<irc://irc.oftc.net/virgil3d>`_, someone will redirect you if
necessary.
Remember that not everyone is in the same timezone as you, so it might
take a while before someone qualified sees your question.
